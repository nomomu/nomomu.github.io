           Arthritis is a common condition that causes pain and inflammation in a joint. A number of people have arthritis or other, similar conditions that affect the joints. Arthritis affects people of all ages, including children. </p>
 
<p class="bodyText">Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are the 2 most common types of arthritis.Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis in the UK, affecting a lot of people. It most often develops in people over 40 or older.</p>

<p class="bodyText">It's also more common in women and people with a family history of the condition. But it can occur at any age as a result of an injury or be associated with other joint-related conditions, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis.</p>

<p class="bodyText">Osteoarthritis initially affects the smooth cartilage lining of the joint. This makes movement more difficult than usual, leading to pain and stiffness. Once the cartilage lining starts to roughen and thin out, the tendons and ligaments have to work harder.</p>

<p class="bodyText">This can cause swelling and the formation of bony spurs called osteophytes.Severe loss of cartilage can lead to bone rubbing on bone, altering the shape of the joint and forcing the bones out of their normal position.</p>

<p class="bodyText">The most commonly affected joints are those in the hands, spine, knees and hips. In rheumatoid arthritis, the body's immune system targets affected joints, which leads to pain and swelling. The outer covering (synovium) of the joint is the first place affected.</p>

<p class="bodyText">This can then spread across the joint, leading to further swelling and a change in the joint's shape. This may cause the bone and cartilage to break down. People with rheumatoid arthritis can also develop problems with other tissues and organs in their body.</p>
